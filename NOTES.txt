Now going back to the logos, im going to give you a few i like this time, as well as the names


SO again i liked the orignal fish with the chevrons:

then in your last download, layker_brand_kit_v4, I liked, layker_lockup_horizontal_light_eye-left & layker_wordmark_light_tagline


I was hoping you could show me a version where you take this image: layker_wordmark_light_tagline

and just the fish from this image, layker_lockup_horizontal_light_eye-left, and place it in the gap between 'Lay' and 'Ker' as you do have a gap between those, i think the fish inbetwwen could be nice on the left algined image


could you show me that now?
